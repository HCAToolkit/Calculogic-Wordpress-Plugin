Calculogic: Advanced Drag-and-Drop Form Builder Plugin (In Planning)

Calculogic is an upcoming drag-and-drop form builder plugin aimed at revolutionizing the way forms are created and managed within WordPress and potentially other platforms. This project is currently in the planning and design phase, and we are laying the groundwork for a suite of advanced features.

Planned Features:

Drag-and-Drop Interface: A user-friendly visual editor for building forms effortlessly.
Advanced Field Types: Calculated fields, repeatable fields, and custom HTML among others.
Dynamic Calculations and Logic: For embedding complex arithmetic and logic directly within forms.
Real-Time Feedback: To provide immediate validation and error messages during form filling.
Collaboration Tools: Designed to support real-time editing and manage user permissions effectively.
Backend Integration: To enable synchronization with databases and external APIs.
Security and Compliance: Prioritizing data integrity and privacy with comprehensive security features.
We invite developers and enthusiasts to join us in shaping the future of form building by providing feedback, suggestions, and contributions. Follow our progress and be part of the journey to create a flexible, powerful, and user-friendly form building experience.

# Calculogic: Advanced Form & Quiz Builder

**Purpose**  
Calculogic is a custom, extensible form and quiz builder designed to eliminate common pain points found in typical form-building plugins or frameworks. It’s built to serve:
1. **My own needs** for H-CAT (Holistic Character Assessment Toolkit) — a system requiring complex quizzes, multi-step logic, and modular data libraries.
2. **Community-driven use cases** where non-technical users can build powerful forms/quizzes without coding.

**Key Goals**
- **Flexible Drag-and-Drop**: Allow users to visually construct forms and quizzes (admin or front-end) with minimal or no custom code.
- **Advanced Logic (Calculations & Workflows)**: Provide a “Calculogic” tab for conditional logic, sum/filter/sort blocks, and referencing data from a shared knowledge library.
- **Shared or Local Data Libraries**: Let users store and reuse data (e.g., Enneagram, Jungian references) across multiple forms/quizzes or keep it local to a single project.
- **User-Centric**: Prioritize real-world needs and intuitive design over monetization. Avoid the typical frustrations of rigid or confusing form builders.

**Why It’s Different**
- **No Hard-Coded Limitations**: The logic system is modular, letting users chain together advanced workflows. 
- **Community-Ready**: Front-end builder for user-created quizzes, with permission controls. 
- **Holistic Integration**: Ties seamlessly into H-CAT’s broad vision (personality quizzes, TTRPG character builders, dynamic worldbuilding, etc.).

**High-Level Architecture**
- **Build/Structure**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating form fields/questions.
- **Calculogic/Workflow**: Visual logic blocks for conditional branching, calculations, dynamic behaviors.
- **View/Styling**: Fine-tune aesthetics (colors, spacing, fonts, icons).
- **Results/Knowledge**: Centralized or local data repositories, with conflict resolution and selective linking.

**Intended Outcome**
By coding Calculogic in a way that emphasizes flexibility, user-friendliness, and advanced logic, I (and the community) can create virtually any form or quiz—simple to highly complex—without constantly writing new code. It’s a single, robust solution to handle everything from basic contact forms to intricate personality assessments, saving time and enabling creativity.
